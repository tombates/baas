<p class="aboutcontent">
  I like to make things: things that are physical and things that are computational.
  While growing up I thought I wanted to make buildings and houses, so
  off I went to architecture school in Oregon. But I've also always loved math and science and I soon switched my major to
  physics.</p>
<p class="aboutcontent">
  After getting a BS in physics, I worked for a time at Hughes Research Labs (HRL) in Malibu, which was like working at a candy store for
  science geeks. But as one of the very few members of the technical staff without a PhD, I thought I should get one myself. So I went
  to UC Santa Barbara planning to work summers back at HRL.</p>
<p class="aboutcontent">
  That was not to be. After my first year of graduate school, when I should have been preparing for my qualifying exams, I
  instead got involved in a tiny software startup you've never heard of. Eventually, just as we were about to run out of food (we'd
  already run out of money), the startup got eaten by a much bigger fish that lives in Seattle. So I moved to the great Northwest.
  My wife, Karin, and I have now
landed in Santa Cruz, a great town also on the central coast and close to the action in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="aboutcontent">As I said, I like to make things, both real and virtual. At one point I became very interested in writing code to make non-representational art created through algorithms. At the time there was really no software for this kind of thing so like all algorists (artist who use algorithms) I had to write my own, which was a great reason to learn Java. Most of the images on this site were made using that software package.</p>
<p class="aboutcontent">Other ways I like to make things: Lost wax bronze casting, traditional printmaking, HTML5 (I've been waiting for the Canvas element for a
very long time), Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Android apps, house and landscape design, kinetic art machines, and writing science fiction...</p>
<p class="aboutcontent">Life is indeed too short. Do while you can.</p>
