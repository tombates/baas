<p class="aboutcontent">
  Because no commercial products did what I wanted, I wrote my own Java graphics package to make these computational, or generative, images. Artistically 
  speaking, this puts me in the camp of the algorists. Algorithmic art allows me 
  to combine my love of art and architecture, my education in physics and general love of science, and my enjoyment of computer programming.</p>
<p class="aboutcontent">
  Layering large numbers of simple but similar elements that vary
  in transparency or other attributes and often have hidden correlations particularly attracts me. I am drawn 
  to the emergence of light and shadow and space from the merely two-dimensional.</p>

<p class="aboutcontent">
  I also like using data or numerical sequences as the starting point for 
  work. Click the sequences tag on the
  image page to view a few of those images. Some of the images are based on the primes, text, DNA 
  sequences, the digits of pi or other transcendental numbers, or just about any other 
  naturally sequential information. I love mixing science and art in this way and I believe it 
  is one way in which these often separate realms can dance with each other. Maybe there are even useful data
  visualization techniques lurking in such play.</p>
<p class="aboutcontent">The work on this site is a small slice of the images I have made or am working on. If a 
  particular image or direction interests you, feel free to contact me to discuss other 
  possibilities or images in the same vein. The images can usually be scaled to any size since they are created as
  vector images. The images on this site are small raster versions of the full images.</p>

<p class="imgcaption_rightnav">Images can be purchased in various sizes. Pricing is determined by size; for example a 12x12 image is $40. Please use the
contact link if you are interested in any of the images.

<p class="imgcaption_rightnav">All prints use high quality archival
inks and are printed on photo quality paper with a lustre matte finish.</p>
<p class="imgcaption_rightnav"> Images can be referenced by their codes, which appear in the about-this-image
popup. See the popup by clicking on the "?" button to the lower right of the image.</p>
<p class="imgcaption_rightnav">I am also available to create custom computational imagery.</p>
